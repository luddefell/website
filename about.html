			<h3>Technical Background</h3>
			<p>I specialize in low-level programming with C/C++ and Python, with hands-on experience in circuit design using LTSpice and mechanical design through SolidWorks. My projects often combine these skills to create integrated systems that solve real-world problems.</p>
			
			<h3>Interests & Aspirations</h3>
			<p>Beyond engineering, I'm deeply interested in mycology, viticulture, and sailingâ€”interests that have influenced my approach to sustainable technology. I'm particularly drawn to renewable energy applications and hope to contribute to solutions that address environmental challenges through innovative engineering.</p>

			<h3>Current Focus</h3>
			<p>At Cornell, I'm exploring how embedded systems and IoT can be applied to agricultural and environmental monitoring, as demonstrated by my Smart Mushroom Tent Monitor project. I'm always looking for opportunities to combine my technical skills with my interests in sustainability and natural systems.</p>
